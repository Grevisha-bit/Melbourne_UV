        <h2>The UV index</h2>
        <p>
            The UV index refers to the degree of possible damage to human skin caused by the ultraviolet radiation in the sun's rays reaching the earth's surface when the sun is at its highest position in the sky. 
            The variation range of the UV index is represented by a number from 0 to 15. Usually, the UV index at night is 0, and the UV index in the tropics, plateau areas, and sunny days is 15. When the UV index is higher, it means that the degree of erythema damage to human skin by UV radiation is aggravated. 
            Similarly, the higher the UV index, the greater the damage to the skin in a shorter period of time.

        <h2>Harm of ultraviolet light</h2>
        <p>Each year, there are more new cases of skin cancer diagnosed in the United States than new cases of breast, prostate, lung and colon cancers combined. One in five Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime. One American dies from skin cancer every hour. 
        Unprotected exposure to UV radiation is the most preventable risk factor for skin cancer.</p>
